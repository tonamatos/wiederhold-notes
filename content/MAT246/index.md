## Additional resources

My course is self-contained. Everything you need to understand and solve any question whose answer constitutes a part of your **grade** can be answered with the material I cover in my lectures. Some of it is mentioned on this site.

**Important:** I do not follow any book, notes or content other than my own, but most topics are covered in many other sources. Students are nevertheless encouraged to consult additional resources like the following. Here are a few:

**All topics**
- Dana C. Ernst - _Introduction to Proof via Inquiry-Based Learning_ [Link](https://danaernst.com/IBL-IntroToProof/)
- Mitchel T. Keller, William T. Trotter - _Applied Combinatorics_ [Link](https://www.appliedcombinatorics.org/book/ch_basics.html)

**Foundations**
- Halmos - _Naive Set Theory_

**The Integers**
- Burton - _Elementary Number Theory_

**Topology**
- Royden and Fitzpatrick - _Real Analysis_ (Chapter 1.4)
- Davidson and Donsig - _Real Analysis and Applications_ (Chapter 4)
