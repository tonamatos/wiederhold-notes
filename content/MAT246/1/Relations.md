There are many important types of relations such as _orders_, _equivalence relations_ and _functions_. For the first two, I am only interested in $A=B$, in which case I call it a _relation on_ $A$; for the latter, I often want different sets.
Depending on the context, I may abbreviate $(a,b)\in R$ by $aRb$.

## Equivalence relations

It will be more convenient to denote these types of relations by the symbol $\sim$ instead of $R$.

>[!def] Definition.

>A relation $\sim$ on a set $A$ is called an _equivalence relation on $A$_ if the following three things hold for any $a,b,c\in A$.
>1. $a\sim a$ (_Reflexivity_, like the reflection of a mirror);
>2. $a\sim b$ implies $b\sim a$ (_Symmetry_, as in, you can flip the order); and
>3. $a\sim b$ and $b\sim c$ implies that $a\sim c$ (_Transitivity_, like there are shortcuts in the transit).

>Compare the above properties with the [[Elementary set theory#^thm-basic-subseteq|basic properties]] of the $\subseteq$ relation.

>[!note] Exercise.

>For each subset of the above properties (e.g., non-**reflexive**, **symmetric** and non-**transitive**), find an example of a relation that satisfies exactly those properties.

>1. An _equivalence class_ is a set of the form $[x]_\sim:=\{y\in X:x\sim y\}$;
>2. The _quotient_ is the set $X/\sim$ of all equivalence classes.

For an example, imagine we define an equivalence relation on the set $S$ of all students taking this course by having two students be related if their first name starts with the same letter. In this case, each equivalence class corresponds to a letter of the alphabet, and the quotient is essentially the set of all letters needed to cover all the students. Thus if say no student's name starts with the letter `Ã‘`, this letter is omitted from the quotient.

>[!thm] Proposition.
>
>1. Equivalence classes are _pairwise disjoint_, that is, the intersection of two different classes is the empty set.
>2. $[x]_\sim=[y]_\sim$ if and only if $x\sim y$.

>[!hint] Hard problem.
>
>Given any relation $\sim$ on a set $X$, you should find it easy to _extend_ it (that is, to find a relation $\sim'\supseteq\sim$) to a relation that is reflexive. You should also find it straightforward to extend it to a reflexive relation. Can you extend it to a transitive one? How?
>
>**Note:** This problem has a "trivial" solution if you consider the equivalence relation $aRb$ iff $a,b\in X$. The idea is to find a solution that is _minimal_. That is, one that contains the given relation $\sim$, but no other relation satisfying the properties.
